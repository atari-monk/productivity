Rewiewing, i see, i pretty much wasted 16 hours
I am not sure why this happened
After 3 project with simple game engine
I wanted to optimize them with prompts, document what it is
I had 2 components, canvas and engine
I comunicated them with interface in shared lib
Extracted two shared classes
I was optimizing them with prompts
Events are handled in components, so no need for centralizing it
Wrappers over browser api is just pointless and insane
Classes were removed
I guess i was procrastinating and wanted prompt automation to much
Only thing out of this is scripts for prompting
It may turn out to be not that usefull
This gives me thouth that a lot of time, best code is removed one
Need clear, measured goals
Prepare stable version
