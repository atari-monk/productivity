# **proj-log.txt Cheat Sheet**

*Simple rules to keep your log clean and decluttered*

---

## **1. Entry Structure**

```
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM-HH:MM xhym project-name
Notes line 1
Notes line 2
(blank line)
```

*   **Start/End time**: HH\:MM 24-hour format
*   **xhym**: Duration (e.g., `1h30m`, `45m`, `2h`). If `0h` or `0m`, don't write it.
*   **Project name**: lowercase, hyphen-separated
*   **Notes**: one thought per line, capitalize first letter
*   **Blank line** separates entries

---

## **2. Writing Notes**

*   Short, simple lines
*   Don’t overthink punctuation
*   Capture only relevant info

✅ **Example with Duration:**

```
2025-09-19 09:30-11:00 1h30m cli-revamp
Fixed parser bug
Normalized old entries
```

---

## **3. Project Names**

*   Be consistent
*   Use the same lowercase/hyphen style every time
*   Avoid synonyms or variations

---

## **4. End Time & Duration**

*   **End Time** is optional if unknown (`2025-09-19 09:30-`). Fill it in later.
*   **Duration** (`xhym`) is calculated from the start and end times. It is **optional to write manually**.
    *   *Pro Tip:* You can use a CLI tool to automatically calculate and add the duration for you, saving time and ensuring accuracy.

---

## **5. Decluttering**

*   Once a week or month:
    *   Remove irrelevant entries
    *   Fix formatting inconsistencies
*   Small regular cleanup beats huge, stressful overhauls

---

## **6. Minimalism Rule**

*   Keep only what matters: date, time, project, notes
*   No extra tags, labels, or metadata unless optional and useful

---

## **7. Optional Enhancements**

*   **Duration**, total time, or project stats can be generated by a CLI
*   Optional `[tag]` in notes sparingly if useful

---

✅ **Remember:**
Format is designed for **speed, simplicity, and decluttering**. Stick to this cheat sheet, and your log will stay tidy and stress-free.
