Perfect! Here’s a **one-page TXP cheat sheet** — simple, visual, and easy to follow daily:

---

# **TXP Log Cheat Sheet**

*Simple rules to keep your TXT log clean and decluttered*

---

## **1. Entry Structure**

```
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM-HH:MM project-name
Notes line 1
Notes line 2
(blank line)
```

* **Start/End time**: HH\:MM 24-hour format
* **Project name**: lowercase, hyphen-separated
* **Notes**: one thought per line, capitalize first letter
* **Blank line** separates entries

---

## **2. Writing Notes**

* Short, simple lines
* Don’t overthink punctuation
* Capture only relevant info

✅ Example:

```
2025-09-19 09:30-11:00 cli-revamp
Fixed parser bug
Normalized old entries
```

---

## **3. Project Names**

* Be consistent
* Use the same lowercase/hyphen style every time
* Avoid synonyms or variations

---

## **4. End Time**

* Optional if unknown (`2025-09-19 09:30-`)
* Fill later when done
* Helps track open sessions

---

## **5. Decluttering**

* Once a week or month:

  * Remove irrelevant entries
  * Fix formatting inconsistencies
* Small regular cleanup beats huge, stressful overhauls

---

## **6. Minimalism Rule**

* Keep only what matters: date, time, project, notes
* No extra tags, labels, or metadata unless optional and useful

---

## **7. Optional Enhancements**

* Duration, total time, or project stats can be generated by a CLI
* Optional `[tag]` in notes sparingly if useful

---

✅ **Remember:**
TXP is designed for **speed, simplicity, and decluttering**. Stick to this cheat sheet, and your log will stay tidy and stress-free.

If you like, I can also **make a tiny visual diagram** showing an entry’s structure — like a mini blueprint for each log block. That helps make it even easier to glance at and follow. Do you want me to do that?
