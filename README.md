# This is a 'productivity' support repository.

The point is to measure projects development with logs.

---

## **Project Structure**

```bash
/productivity
 ├─ content/               # Folder with project logs
 └─ README.md              # This Project Manifesto ✨
```

This should stay intentionally simple, only in text form.  
Each project has its log file.
