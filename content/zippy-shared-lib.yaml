              - Rewiewing, i see, i pretty much wasted 16 hours.
                I am not sure why this happened.
                After 3 project with simple game engine, i wanted to optimize them with prompts, document what it is.
                I had 2 components, canvas and engine.
                I comunicated them with interface in shared lib.
                Extracted two shared classes.
                I was optimizing them with prompts.
                Events are handled in components, so no need for centralizing it.
                Wrappers over browser api is just pointless and insane.
                Classes were removed.
                I guess i was procrastinating and wanted prompt automation to much.
                Only thing out of this is scripts for prompting, but it may turn out to be not that usefull.
                This gives me thouth that a lot of time, best code is removed one.
                Need clear, measured goals.
              - Prepare stable version
              - Documentation,
              - Fix git history (reset history, 'Initial commit')
              - Publish npm package
